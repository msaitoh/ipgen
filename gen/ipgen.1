.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is an L2 and L3 traffic generator with the following design goals:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
Wire-speed support based on
.Li Netmap
API
on
.Fx
or
.Li XDP
on Linux,
.It
Benchmarking capability with multiple packet flows,
.It
Interative user interface to show various statistics,
and
.It
RFC 2544 benchmarking methodology.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example does a loopback test assuming
.Li igb1
with MAC address
.Li 00:11:22:33:44:55
and
.Li igb2
with
.Li 66:77:88:99:aa:bb
are on a box running
.Nm
and the two ports are directrly connected by
an Ethernet cable
.Pq back-to-back connection defined in Section 3.1, RFC 1242 .
Note that each gateway address must be specified to the MAC address
of another endpoint:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
ipgen -T igb1,66:77:88:99:aa:bb -R igb2,00:11:22:33:44:55
.Ed
.Pp
If the two Ethernet cables are connected to
.Li igb1
and
.Li igb2
and the another endpoint is a bridge box,
such as an Ethernet hub or switch to form a single L2 segment,
the same command performs an L2 forwarding performance test of the bridge box.
.Pp
The following example does an L3 forwarding performance test.
A box running
.Nm
has
.Li igb1
with an address
.Li 192.18.0.1/24
and
.Li igb2
with
.Li 192.18.1.1/24 ,
and two Ethernet cables are connected to another box
.Pq DUT: Device Under Test
that can forward TCP/IP packets,
such as a router.
This assumes that the DUT has
.Li 192.18.0.2/24
and
.Li 192.18.1.2/24
on the interfaces connected to each segment:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
ipgen -T igb1,192.18.0.2,192.18.0.1/24 -R igb2,192.18.1.2,192.18.1.1/24
.Ed
.Pp
The flag
.Fl -rfc2544
enables RFC 2544 benchmarking report.
When specified,
.Nm
shows throughput
.Pq Section 3.17 in RFC 1242
and frame loss rate
.Pq Section 3.6 in RFC 1242
of a DUT throughout the entire range of
input data rates and frame sizes
after the test finishes.
The following example shows RFC 2544 benchmarking report for the same testing
setup for the L2 forwarding example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
ipgen -T igb1,66:77:88:99:aa:bb -R igb2,00:11:22:33:44:55 --rfc2544
